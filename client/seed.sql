I hit golden hour just right and the Alps were glowing. The approach into LOWI was smooth (for once ðŸ˜…), with a bit of turbulence on final, but nothing too crazy. I used the G1000 and some real-time weather â€” light winds, broken clouds, and that signature Alpine haze.', 'SkyCaptain87', 0, '2021-05-12', 1),

Heavy rain, gusting crosswinds up to 30 knots, and low visibility had my palms sweating (and Iâ€™m not even in a real cockpit ðŸ˜…).

The new lighting and weather engine in XP12 made the whole experience incredibly immersive. Lightning flashes lit up the clouds on descent, runway lights shimmering through the rain â€” it was like something out of a movie. Managed a decent landing on 22L despite a bit of float.', 'TorqueMaster99', 0, '2023-11-23', 4);
