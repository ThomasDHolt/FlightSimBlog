## What requirements did I achieve?
- I was able to display posts with options for sorting between ascending and descending.
- I designed my DB tables so that each record of the comments table references a post in the posts table.
- I was able to make a dynamic page which shows a post and it's affiliated comments, however there is no functionality for leaving comments at the moment.

## Were there any requirements or goals that I was unable to achieve?
- I was unable to implement a delete button for deleting posts.
- I was unable to implement creating new posts.
- Although I had planned for categories with my DB, I ran out of time to implement them fully.
- Neither posts or comments can be edited at the moment.

## If so, what was it that I found difficult about these tasks?
- None of these tasks were difficult, I just ran out of time due to leaving for my holiday on Saturday. I think if circumstances had been different and I didn't have to also work on week 9 in the mean time then I would have gone much further with this assignment.
